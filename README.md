# William

## What's William?
William is a direct messaging app for the Shipwrecked badge. It allows for peer-to-peer messaging using only symbols to communicate ideas. Ideas are defined by each section of buttons on the badge, like current location, items, and more.

## Setting it Up
To set up William on a flashed badge, open up the [webflasher](https://badge.shipwrecked.hackclub.com) on a chromium-based browser (for webserial). Next, connect the badge's serial port (Board in FS Mode or Board CDC). Wait for the App Management to finish scanning, then hit "Upload App", and put in the william.zip file. Wait a few minutes for upload, and you're off to the races!

## Using William
To use the William app, navigate to the app on the home screen and launch it. Press a button corresponding to a symbol, and your friend will receive it!
